- 👋 Hi, I’m @JagodoveLove
- 👀 I’m interested in probably more than 1000 things for less than 3 months. At the moment I'm doing my best to become "IT guy" ;)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Python, SQL, and who knows. I am at a very beginning of this journey and not really sure what to start with. Just give me some time...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: For now? On nothing.
- 📫 How to reach me
